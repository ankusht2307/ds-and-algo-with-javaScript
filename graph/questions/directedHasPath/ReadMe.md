# 🧭 Has Path in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

This project contains an implementation of a function `hasPath(graph, source, destination)` to determine whether a path exists between two nodes in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a directed graph represented as an adjacency list (with no cycles), implement a function to determine if there exists a path from the `source` node to the `destination` node.

### Function Signature

```javascript
hasPath(graph, source, destination) => boolean
