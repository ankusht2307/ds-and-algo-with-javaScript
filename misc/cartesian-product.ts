/**
 * Problem: Given two finite non-empty sets, find their Cartesian Product.
 *
 * In mathematics, the Cartesian Product of two sets A and B, denoted A Ã— B,
 * is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Set A = [1, 2]
 * Set B = [3, 4]
 *
 * Cartesian Product = [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
